# Simplex
Simple and ugly program for specific needs.
### Installation
Simplex requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.9+ to run installed on your OS.
Older versions could not work as expected.

### Dependencies

```sh
$ python -m pip install -U pip
```

* [Click] - Python CLI

```sh
$ python -m pip install -U click
```

* [Matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static,
                 animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
```sh
$ python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```


### Tech

Simplex uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python 3] - Python interpreter
* [Matplotlib] - Library for plotting

And of course Simplex itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

I'm aware this code is not great and I'm pretty new to coding so if you have any  
recommendations how to make it better I'm all in.

Pull request or email me.

### Todos

 - Compare mode
 - Plot mode
 - Better documentation
