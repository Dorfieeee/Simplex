# Simplex
Simplex is Python 3 command-line program for effortless processing of your data.

### Installation
Simplex requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.9+ to run installed on your OS.
Older versions could not work as expected.

### Dependencies

```sh
$ python -m pip install -U pip
```

* [Click] - Python CLI

```sh
$ python -m pip install -U click
```

* [Matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static,
                 animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
```sh
$ python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```


### Tech

Simplex uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python 3] - Python interpreter
* [Matplotlib] - Library for plotting

And of course Simplex itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
