# Simplex
Simplex is Python 3 command-line program for effortless processing of your data.

### Installation
Simplex requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ to run installed on your OS.
Older versions could not work as expected.

- 1. Install Python on your OS
- 2. Download this code repository by clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting Zip file.
- 3. Unzip and save the folder somewhere you like.
- 4. Open your OS command line/terminal and go to Simplex directory.* [Help]
- 5. For the first time, run `$ python simplex.py build`, if this fails, install all dependencies manually listed bellow
- 6. Ready to go

### Usage
The easiest way is to open your terminal and go to Simplex directory.
```sh
$ python simplex.py [options] command
```
For all options and commands, type
```sh
$ python simplex.py --help
```

This program can convert your .ocw and .P00 files into .csv + graphs.
The only thing you need to tell the program is where your files are and what to do with them.
```sh
$ python simplex.py [what type? -f for file or -i for directory] [where? path] [what to do? command] 
```

Let's say I want to convert all files with .ocw extension in one directory, so I will use -i option for --input and type where the directory is and tell what to do with it by using jvc command(Currentâ€“voltage characteristic)
```sh
$ python simplex.py -i myFilesDirectory jvc 
```
Will tell the program to select all files with .ocw extension in myFilesDirectory and generate .csv + graps

You can also select one or multiple files to work with by using -f / --file option eg.
```sh
$ python simplex.py -f myFile.ocw jvc
```
or for multiple files
```sh
$ python simplex.py -f myFile.ocw -f mySecondFile.ocw jvc
```

### Dependencies

```sh
$ python -m pip install -U pip
```

                 animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
